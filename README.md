# RPi-Fan-Driver
A simple PWM-based driver for your Raspberry Pi Fan

## What is this?
This is a DIY project for adding a driver for your Raspberry Pi fan. Using its GPIO pins, some cheap components, a bit of Python code and a custom PCB, the fan can be used at various speeds depending on temperature instead of having 2 different speeds using 3.3 and 5V pins. In addition, it is beginner-friendly enough so that anyone can make this easily in a short amount of time.

## What do I need for making this myself?
Just a little bunch of things:

- A PN2222A (or similar transistor)
- A common diode
- 1K resistor
- A bunch of jumper wires (or common wires for soldering them)
- Soldering iron
- The PCB in this repo (I ordered it at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com))
